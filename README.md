# STL_Part2

In this challenge you will create a menu-driven application that
will simulate a user playing songs from a playlist of songs.

We will use a list to simulate the user selecting the first song in the playlist and
then selecting next and previous to play forward of backwards through the 
playlist.

We will also allow users to add new song to the playlist
The menu looks as follows:

F - Play First Song

N - Play Next song

P - Play Previous song

A - Add and play a new Song at current location

L - List the current playlist

========================

Enter a selection (Q to quit):

And the available playlist is modeled as a std::list<Song>
Following are the songs in the playlist.
I grabbed these from the pop charts, you can use them or change 
them to any songs you wish.
